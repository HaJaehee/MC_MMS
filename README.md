## Usage
First of all, MMS Server including MMS Monitoring Module depends on Ubuntu 16.04, OpenJDK 1.8, <br/>
RabbitMQ 3.7.14, erlang/OTP 22.0, Maven 3.3.9 and Docker 18.09.2.<br/>
Also, MMS Server is compilable and runnable on Windows 10.<br/>
When using Debian/Ubuntu Linux, follow instructions below and install dependencies before executing <br/>
script [MMSServer/scripts/deploy-mms.sh]:<br/>
<code>sudo apt update</code><br/>
<code>sudo apt install default-jdk maven rabbitmq-server docker docker-compose</code> <br/>
Before building MMS Server, specify configuration files in [MMSServer/MMS-configuration] directory.<br/>

<b>QUICK DEPLOY:</b> run the script [deploy-mms.sh] at the directory [MMSServer/scripts/]. <br/>
<code>cd MMSServer/scripts </code><br/>
<code>sudo sh deploy-mms.sh [domain name]</code><br/>
It will automatically build and run MMS Server, MMS Monitoring Module and related services.<br/>
After running MMS Monitoring Module docker container, re-configure detailed configurations of <br/>
apache2 in [/etc/apache2/] in the docker container.<br/>

<b>ONLY BUILD AND START MMS SERVER:</b> run the scripts at the directory [MMSServer/Linux/].<br/>
<code>cd MMSServer/Linux </code><br/>
<code>sudo sh build_mms.sh </code><br/>
<code>sudo sh start_mms.sh </code><br/>
<code>sudo sh start_mns.sh </code><br/>

### After accomplishment
In order to use email service, please reconfigure the WP Mail SMTP Plugin of WordPress admin panel.<br/>
We recommend to use Google SSMTP service.<br/>
Default admin account of MMS Monitoring Module (WordPress wp-login.php) is Administrator/Administrator.<br/>

<b>TLS SUPPORT:</b> check web sites below:</br>
[RabbitMQ TLS Support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html)  <br/>
[Docker Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/)<br/>
[Apache Install SSL Certificate](https://www.digicert.com/csr-ssl-installation/apache-openssl.htm)<br/>
[HTTPS for WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/) <br/>
<b>MMS SERVER TLS SUPPORT:</b> check instructions below:<br/>
[Import Individual Certificates into your Keystore](https://www.attachmate.com/documentation/gateway-1-1/gateway-admin-guide/data/fxg_keytool_importcert.htm)<br/>
In order to get Base64 endcoded keystore for SSL enabled MMS Server from the jks, use [MMSKeystoreCoder] <br/>
and get Base64 encoded string that is printed out to the console. <br/>
Copy the string and paste it to a value of "KEYSTORE" in [MMSServer/target/MMS-configuration/MMS.conf]. <br/>
After then, restart the MMS Server.<br/>

<b>MMS uses [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/license/) https://wordpress.org/about/license/</b><br/>
GNU Public License<br/>
The license under which the WordPress software is released is the GPLv2<br/>
(or later) from the Free Software Foundation. A copy of the license is<br/>
included with every copy of WordPress, but you can also read the text<br/>
of the license here.<br/>
Part of this license outlines requirements for derivative works, such <br/>
as plugins or themes. Derivatives of WordPress code inherit the GPL <br/>
license. Drupal, which has the same GPL license as WordPress, has an <br/>
excellent page on licensing as it applies to themes and modules (their <br/>
word for plugins).<br/>
There is some legal grey area regarding what is considered a derivative <br/>
work, but we feel strongly that plugins and themes are derivative work<br/>
and thus inherit the GPL license. If you disagree, you might want to<br/>
consider a non-GPL platform such as Serendipity (BSD license) or Habari <br/>
(Apache license) instead.<br/>
